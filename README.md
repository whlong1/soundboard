# **soundboard**

## **Project Description**

**soundboard** is an online repository of music information. **soundboard** utilizes the **TheAudioDB API** to organize information on recording artists in a user-friendly interface. With **soundboard**, users can find an artist's biography, full discography, and even information on individual albums. **soundboard** also provides users with an up to date list of the top trending albums on iTunes. 

**Website:**

## **Mockups**

Below is a mockup of the site's "Find an Artist" feature. My goal here was to keep the user's focus on the content, with an unobtrusive and versatile design. Rendering a predefined layout also represents a unique challenge in terms of CSS.

## **User Experience**

Upon entering the site, a user will be greeted with a welcome message outlining the features of the site. A user may navigate to the find an artist page, or the music charts page. With the artist search bar, a user can find access an artist's biography, discography, and details on specific albums.

#### User Story One

>As a young music fan, I want to familiarize myself with the supposed luminaries of my favorite musical genre. With **soundboard** I can view an artist's full discography with an easy to use interface. 

#### User Story Two

>>As a long time music fan, I want to know what music is currently trending. With **soundboard** I can view the top trending albums on iTunes.
